# Mission // #002
## Operation Ferryman's Bane

Patience puts the colony at its maximum security level and asks the squad to be on high alert. They are asked to stay around the colony while Evergreen scouts try to predict the movements of the Hercynian raiders.  
Before anyone can gather more intel, a nighttime attack on the colony forces the team into action.

# Goals
- Establish face to face contact with resistance leaders on the ground.
- Defend the remaining crossing across the Kinska River, the Saarf√ºrt Bridge and surrounding neighborhood.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, the last pocket of organized resistance on the planet will fall. This cannot be tolerated for future liasing purposes and would force the *Bolte Face* out of local space when enemy forces sieze the planetary defence batteries.

# Reserves
- Onboard baffling systems appear to be able to overcome groundside ECCM.
